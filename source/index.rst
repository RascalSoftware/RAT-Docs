Reflectivity Algorithms Toolbox (RAT) is a toolbox for analysing neutron reflectivity data at multiple contrasts.
It has been designed as the calculation engine for the upcoming RasCAL-2,
which will supersede the reflectivity software `RasCAL <https://github.com/arwelHughes/RasCAL_2019>`_. 

It is designed to be flexible, allowing analysis using traditional layer models,
but also using user-defined custom models, which can be parameterised by the user however they wish
(either as an array of layers, or a continuous SLD profile). 
It is also incredibly fast; the core algorithm code is native C++, 
created from the MATLAB source code using `MATLAB Coder <https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab-coder.html>`_.

By separating the GUI from the toolbox, users can create and run a full analysis from a script, 
which can be written in either our MATLAB or Python API. 
This means that the reflectivity analysis can be integrated alongside other analysis tools written in MATLAB or Python, 
and this analysis script can be provided alongside publications to ensure reproducible data.

RAT contains a number of improvements over legacy RasCAL, including:

* :ref:`Automatic parallelisation<parallelisation>` (MPI) either over contrasts or points using a simple flag
* Advanced interface microslicing using :ref:`adaptive resampling<resampling>`
* Option to write :ref:`custom models<customLanguages>` in MATLAB, Python or C++
* Custom models for background and resolution functions (not yet functional)
* Fast Bayesian analysis using :ref:`DREAM<DREAM>`
* An integrated :ref:`Nested sampler<nestedSampling>` for Bayesian model selection
* Fully validated against ORSO examples
* Ability to :ref:`load and run RasCAL-1 projects<conversionFuncs>` (usually) without modification
* :ref:`Plotting routines<simplePlotting>` for easy visualisation of data and fits
* and more!
