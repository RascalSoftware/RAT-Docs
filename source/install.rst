        RAT can be used either by running the m-files directly or using a compiled mex file. 
        RAT ships with a pre-compiled MEX file which is available to download from the |release| page. 
        To use the mex do the following:

        1. Download the source code and the pre-compiled mex for your operating system.
        2. Extract the source code and the mex files.
        3. Open MATLAB and navigate to the folder containing the RAT source code.
        4. Run *addPaths.m* which will add the necessary paths
        5. Run your script.

        However, if you want to build RAT on your local machine, you need to follow the steps below.

        **Build the MEX on your local machine**
        
        A C/C++ compiler and MATLAB (2021 or later) is required for building the mex. The following MATLAB toolboxes are also required:

        - MATLAB Coder
        - MATLAB Compiler
        - Parallel Computing Toolbox

        To build the mex, do the following:

        1. Download the RAT source code from the `Github release page <https://github.com/RascalSoftware/RAT/releases/latest>`_.
        2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the folder containing the RAT source code.
        3. Run *addPaths.m* then run *buildScript.m* in MATLAB. This will add the necessary paths and builds the MEX file. This could take several minutes depending on your machine.
        4. The MEX files will be created in the **RAT/compile** folder.

        If no error shows up, you should be able to run the MEX file.

        The RAT API for Python can be installed from PyPI as follows

        .. code-block:: console

            pip install RATapi

        ``matlabengine`` is an optional dependency only required for MATLAB related actions such as running MATLAB custom functions and converting RasCAL-1 projects.
        The version of ``matlabengine`` should match the version of MATLAB installed on the computer. For example, if MATLAB 2023a is installed on the computer, 
        ``matlabengine`` can be installed as shown below:

        .. code-block:: console

            pip install RATapi[Matlab-2023a]

        .. note::
            
            MATLAB does not support every version of Python so you have to ensure to use a Python version that is supported by your installed MATLAB. 
            You can check the `Python compatibility <https://mathworks.com/support/requirements/python-compatibility.html>`_ on the MATLAB website.
